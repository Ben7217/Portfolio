<p id="p">It all started with Mam's chocolate-chip, oatmeal cookie. Simple, fresh, and delicious. My family has been enjoying this cookies for years and to this day, we have yet to find a better tasting chocolate-chip cookie. Mam is actually Dona Morris (her nickname is Mam because when I was little I was unable to say "grandma" and instead said 'Mam'). Dona was a hairdresser for most of her life, but always loved cooking and baking. She has held this cookie receipie extreemly secret and the only person besides herself that has a copy is my Mother, Elizabeth Morris.</p>

<p>We had to verify with Mam that the reciepie she gave us is the correct reciepie, because she is known to give out fake versions with incorrect ingridients or amounts... This is serious business!</p>

<p>Give one of our cookies a try and I can guarentee it will not only be the best chocolate-chip cookie you have ever had, but it will be one damn good cookie!</p>
