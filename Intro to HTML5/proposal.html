  <p> This summer, my mother and I are going to begin selling my grandma's cookies made with her 
    excellent recipe at farmers markets in the Colorado Springs, CO area. This is a great oppourtunity to put together a simple site to display some information about her awesome cookies, as well as add some javascript items like a calander with where we will be any given week. I will also implement some links to social media, etc.  </p>  
  
<p> My target market is of course people that love made from scratch baked goods/cookies! They really are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had and a lot of others agree. They aren't like a typical cookie that most people bake!</p>
