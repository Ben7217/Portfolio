  <p>
  Besides music, magic has been one of my longest and most concentrated studies (well, besides University work).
<br><br>
  I think people would truly be surprised by not only the history, but the amount of information related to teh subject.
  I personally have spent thousands of dollars in building up my "magic book" library and it doesn't even look like much.
<br><br>
  Too often non-magicians think of magicians in this either clown-like or creepy type of way. This isn't anyone's fault however.
  Magicians have made a mockery of themselves for the last 50 years and it is only now starting to change back
  to a performance based art. Magic is not an art within itself, but there are some that can elivate it to a new level.
<br><br>
  I have been creating my own tricks for years. My main area of study is sleight of hand with cards or coins, but
  I enjoy coming upu with creative solutions to something that seems impossible. Some of the smartest people in the world
  are magicians. Seriously...
<br><br>
  I have a trick coming out with Will Tsai's company soon. Will Tsai is on this season of Americas Got Talent, so
  I am hoping not only much sucess for him, but as well as PR for the company.

  Here is will on America's Got Talent:
