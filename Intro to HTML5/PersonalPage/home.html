    I am 29 years old and I live in Larkspur, Colorado. I am a musician, magician, and I am continuing my education
    at the UMass for a second degree in IT.



    This isn't my first crack at html. Years ago I designed a very basic webpage using photoshop and html. It didn't have any interactive buttons, but the images were links.
    Javascript would have helped me out quite a bit now that I think about it.



    I have a website currently that I use to sell playing cards and other magic related items. In fact, I have designed my own deck of playing cards
    and I will be launching the campaign on Kickstarter sometime this summer! You can check out the website at: <a href="http://www.modernconjurer.com" target="_blank">Modern Conjurer</a>

    As you can see, it is a more modern webpage, built using a Wordpress template and modified. With Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace, users don't really have to work very hard to
    build a modern, clean webiste these days.

    I am currently taking this class not only to fulfill credit requirements, but to refresh my learning on html as well as css. I never really understood css until making this page,
    so I appreciate the assignment! Not saying this is some beautifully crafted web page (it isn't), but the functionality and basic understanding is there.
