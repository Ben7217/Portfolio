<blockquote>
  <p>
  Music holds a lot of importance in my life. When I was 21 I joined a band that
was determined to make it. I sacrificed for years of my life, selling my vehicle for a trailer for tour,
giving up any career oppourtunities right after I gradudated high school, working
minimum-wage jobs to pay my bills and buy better equipment (while not worrying if I just quit), going into tens of
thousands of dollars in debt, etc. I love music. <br><br>

I play guitar and I have an ESP Eclipse Silverburst and a Gibson Les Paul studio that I wouldn't trade
for the world. Life would be pretty damn dull without music.<br><br>

The band I was in was a metalcore band and might not be for everyone, but all the same, here is a sample of what we did.
Sadly, we broke up in 2014. </p>
