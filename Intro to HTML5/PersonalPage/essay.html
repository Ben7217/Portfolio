        Should There be Standards in Web Development?
      </h2>
        </hgroup>
      </div>

<p>Before there were a handful of browsers to choose from, developers did not need to worry about a standard of coding. Computers and the internet were a luxury item that had not yet proliferated society. The internet has changed the way we shop, learn, interact, work, read news, and entertain ourselves. We depend on the internet and standardization is crucial to make sure our dependencies are constant and met without fault; but perhaps it depends on the end goal?
	<br><br>Web standards were put into play for a variety of reasons, some more important than others. I believe that it is important that for the most part, developers stick to this standardization of methods so that all users can have the same experience across the broad spectrum of individuals and technology used. For example, A blind Chrome user should have the same experience as a seeing Safari user. The text should be read out loud to the blind user in the same manner a seeing user would interpret it. The browser choice should not matter when it comes to actually viewing the page (a browser debate is a different topic entirely).
	<br><br>The issue with following standards 100% of the time, is the lack of evolution. If we all did the same thing, every single day, we wouldn’t push ourselves or push the world around us to develop better things. If a developer has a new concept, app, or website idea that needs to implement a non-standard way of thinking, and it pushes the technology forward, I believe this is ok. I think as long as the web is available to all users on all browsers, changing a bit of code to evolve a technology forward.
	<br><br>Oh, and yes, flash was over when Apple did not incorporate it into the first iPhone. You can say what you want about Apple, but what they do, the industry tends to follow. Flash is inconvenient and buggy. Most videos and animations these days use HTML5 because it doesn’t require anything extra to be downloaded, just the browser already on the users device. This brings us full circle: Developers must adhere to a set of standards to make sure these HTML5 videos are viewable on all devices, but breaking the rules every now and then to advance a technology is alright by me.
