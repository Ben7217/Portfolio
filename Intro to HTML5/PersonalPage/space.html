<h2> Space: </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
  I find space, space travel, and the science, such as astrophysics, fascinating. Additionally,
  I am also into weird things like UFO's and other paranormal pseudo sciences.
  My favorite astrophysicist and number one original gangster is Neil deGrasse Tyson,
  who is of course the host of Cosmos and just an all around fascinating and intelligent guy.<br><br>
  Below is one of my favorite videos that really makes you realize how small
  our existence truly matters, but at the same time how important it is to
  live life fully. </p>
